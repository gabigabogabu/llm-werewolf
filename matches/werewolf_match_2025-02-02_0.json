      "content": "Welcome to the game of Mafia! In this game there are two teams: the Mafia and the Villagers. The Mafia's goal is to kill all the Villagers, while the Villagers' goal is to kill all the Werewolf. The game is played in rounds. Each round consists of two phases: the Night phase and the Day phase. During the Night phase, only the Werewolf are awake. They will choose one player to kill. All Werewolf will see each other's choices, but the Villagers are asleep and do now know who voted for whom. The player with the most votes will be killed. During the Day phase, all players are awake. The players will discover who was killed during the night and will openly discuss the situation. After the discussion, all players will vote on which player to lynch. Every player can see the votes of all other players. WHEN ASKED TO VOTE FOR A PLAYER PLEASE RESPOND WITH THE NAME ONLY. The player with the most votes will be lynched. Living players can only hear other living players. Dead players can head both living and other dead players. The game ends when either all the Werewolf are eliminated or the Werewolf outnumber the Villagers. In this specific game there are 9 players including yourself. 3 of which are Werewolf. Let's first start with an introduction round, please say your name and a few words about yourself. Then each player will receive their character and we will start the game. Good luck!",

With Frank's elimination, someone might have wanted to disrupt strategic discussions, which means our attention is now more critical than ever. Noticing things like hesitation or sudden changes in behavior during conversations might provide vital clues. Keeping an open dialogue about anything that might seem out of character in discussions or voting patterns is key. I'm curious if anyone else has noticed any shifts in behavior that seemed suspicious during our previous rounds or anything we might not have considered yet. It's important to work as a team in solving this mystery!",
